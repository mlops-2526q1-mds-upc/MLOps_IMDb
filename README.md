Film review sentiment analysis.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project environment and run the complete pipeline:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- [DVC](https://dvc.org/) for data versioning and pipeline management

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd MLOps_IMDb
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**
   ```bash
   make create_environment
   source ./.venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
   # or
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   make requirements
   # or directly with uv
   uv sync
   ```

4. **Download the IMDB dataset**
   ```bash
   python scripts/download_imdb.py
   ```

5. **Run the complete DVC pipeline**
   ```bash
   dvc repro
   ```

This will execute all pipeline stages in order:
- **prepare**: Clean and preprocess the raw IMDB data
- **features**: Build TF-IDF features from the cleaned text
- **train**: Train the sentiment analysis model
- **eval**: Evaluate the model and generate metrics

### Alternative: Run individual stages

You can also run individual pipeline stages:

```bash
# Data preparation
dvc repro prepare

# Feature engineering
dvc repro features

# Model training
dvc repro train

# Model evaluation
dvc repro eval
```

### Verify Setup

After running the pipeline, you should see:
- Processed data in `data/processed/`
- Trained models in `models/`
- Evaluation metrics in `reports/metrics.json`
- Visualization plots in `reports/figures/`

### Development Commands

```bash
# Run tests
make test

# Format code
make format

# Lint code
make lint

# Clean compiled files
make clean
```
