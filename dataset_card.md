## Dataset Summary
The IMDB dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB), labeled for sentiment analysis.  
The dataset is balanced, with 25,000 positive and 25,000 negative reviews. It is commonly used for binary text classification tasks.

## Motivation
The dataset was created to support research in sentiment classification and natural language processing.  
Its goal is to evaluate modelsâ€™ ability to detect sentiment polarity in natural text.

- **Labels**: Binary (positive / negative).  
- **Data type**: Text reviews in English.

## Collection Process
